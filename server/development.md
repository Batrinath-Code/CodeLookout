## Step1: Create a github App for local development

- Use the following [link](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/writing-code-for-a-github-app/quickstart) for reference

- Start following from Step 2 (as we have Go app instead of nodeJS one)

## Step2: Run local developement server

```shell
  chmod +x run.sh
  ./run.sh
```

> Run this smee client to forward github webhooks to development machine
